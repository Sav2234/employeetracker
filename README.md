To begin, enter "node server.js" into the terminal to start the program. You will see a list of things to do such as add, remove, view departments, employees and roles. Use your arrow keys and the enter button to choose and select a highlighted option. Answer the relating questions once an option has been selected. After you have made an employee, you will be asked if you'd like to do anything else. If you are finished can see what you've created by pressing any of the view options.
